## Introduction
Nowadays, people are increasingly using the social media to communicate with the world. The team decides to develop a social media website for our student to chat with friends, post texts, thumbs up and share images. 

## Objective
At first, we design the log in/ sign up functions for the website. People can sign up their own account with customized password longer that 5 digits. 
### Sign up

Then they can log into the website and the website has cookies to store their login information. 
### Log in

If the users enter the wrong password, the system will give them a notification with: Password is incorrect to let them input a new one.
